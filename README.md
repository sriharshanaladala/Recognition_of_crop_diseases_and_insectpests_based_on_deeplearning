# **Recognition Of Crop Diseases End Insect Pests Based On Deeplearning**
# **Software Requirement**
>[!NOTE]
>[python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)

# **How to execute code ?**
1. install the Python 3.7 version in the system
2. make sure system environment variables are updated
  - ### confirming the Python version 
     - open the terminal and type python, you will get the Python version make sure it is 3.7 which supports this code
3. download the zip file from the repository
4. extract the file from the zip file at the desired file location
5. open the file at which it is extracted and copy the path to cmd or idle
6. now install the required modules which are missing to execute
7. run the code from the run.bat file (or) run from the terminal by typing the .py file name
